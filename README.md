This work is a python framework to help researchers and users that want to run powerflux simulations and need simplifications to solve otimization problems. It's developed using Python and OpenDSS using the library <a href="https://github.com/dss-extensions/OpenDSSDirect.py" target="_blank">OpenDSSDirect.py</a>.
This work was developed during the program of  <b>Bolsa Estágio de Pesquisa no Exterior(BEPE)</b> sponsored by <a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank"> Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP)</a> in Porto, Portugal at <b>Research Group on Intelligent Engineering and Computing for Advanced Innovation and Development (GECAD)</b> a unit settled in the <b>Institue of Egineering - Polytechnic of Porto (ISEP/IPP)</b>
